        <h2 class="topic" id="AMLA">AMLA - Anti-Money Laundering Act</h2>
        <p>Money laundering is an unlawful activity that makes the dirty money coming from a legitimate source.</p>
            <p>I recommened watching <strong>Ozark</strong> a netflix series for a better understanding of the AMLA. The series depicts how money laundering works in a practical sense.</p>
            </p>

    <h4>Stages of money Laundering:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Placement:</strong> The initial stage where the illegal funds are <u>introduced</u> into the <strong>financial system</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Layering:</strong> The process of <strong>concealing</strong> the source of the money through a <strong>series of transactions</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Integration:</strong> The final stage where the <strong>laundered money is reintroduced</strong> into the <i>economy</i>, making it appear <strong>legitimate</strong>.</li>
    </ol>

<h4>ILLUSTRATION:</h4>
<img src="amla.png" alt="AML" width="500" height="300" class="amla-image">
<p class="mayspace"><strong>Imagine you're the one doing the act.</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Placement:</strong> In this stage you put your dirty money in an legitimate business. That's why it's called placement.</li>
    <li><strong>Layering:</strong> In this stage you mix your dirty money with the good ones(income of the business) and then put it in the bank.<br>
         That's why it's called layering. Covering your lie with the truth.</li>
    <li><strong>Integration:</strong> The final stage where you can take out your <strong>clean</strong> money in the bank and buy the things you want.<br>
    Making it appear it's hard earned money.</li>
